  title: Genderful Research World
  subtitle: The interactive sex and gender resource platform for biomedical and health scientists.
  intro_body: |
    Genderful Research World (GRW) is a platform made for supporting scientists in health who are looking for resources on how to integrate sex and gender into their own research. 
research:
  title: Research road
  body: Before you hit the road, it is very important that the concepts of gender and sex are clear and correct to you. Take a quiz to test your knowledge in the definitions.
biomedical_research:
  title: Biomedical Research
  info: This category, also known as basic/experimental research, includes animal experiments, cell studies, genetic, biochemical and physiological investigations.
  intro: Sex has historically been overlooked in many areas of biomedical research, with the assumption being that sex is not relevant in certain types of research, female hormonal fluctuations create too much variability to conduct rigorous research, or that the costs associated with conducting sex-based analyses is not worth the benefit. This section will highlight why these assumptions are incorrect, and how rigorous research can and should include consideration of sex. 
health_research:
  title: Health Research
  info: This category includes any research conducted with humans and human data, including epidemiology and population health studies, studies conducted in a clinical setting, health systems research, and community-based studies of clinical populations or questions of clinical relevance.
  intro: Sex and gender represent a range of biological, psychological, and social factors that influence health behaviours, outcomes, and health systems delivery. This section will review why sex and gender are relevant to all stages of the clinical research process, and why integrating a focus on both sex and gender is key for rigorous, inclusive research.
funding:
  title: Funding
  info: This section reviews information regarding the process of identifying funding opportunities and understanding institute-specific mandates for integrating sex and gender into research design, and how to integrate consideration of sex and gender into the research grant at all stages.
  body: Applying a sex and gender lens is increasingly becoming a requirement within funding agencies to encourage all applicants to consider how sex- and gender-based analyses might be relevant to their project. This section will provide resources on how researchers can prepare their application to address these issues, even if investigating sex and gender is not a primary goal of their research.
team_assembly:
  title: Team Assembly
  info: This section reviews information relevant to the assembly and composition of research teams, i.e., who is represented on the team.
  body: Research has suggested that diversity on teams is a key predictor of success, but women and gender-diverse individuals tend to be underrepresented in many areas of science, particularly in leadership positions. Research has also shown that women are more likely to use sex- and gender-based analyses in their research. This section will review information on how to ensure diverse representation on research teams and why it is important.

  title: Genderful Research Consortium (GRC)
  body: |
    Currently, many initiatives and key resources exist to support researchers, including resource lists, online checklists, fact sheets and training modules. However, such resources can be hard to find, busy and overwhelming. As a result, finding relevant resources can be too time consuming and not meeting researchersâ€™ needs. The platform has the goal to provide an overview of key resources per research stage or phase of biomedical, clinical and public health research. Resources were identified and selected by a rapid review performed by our group, with a special focus on resources affiliated with CIHR Institute for Gender and Health (CIHR-IGH) and the European Gendered Innovations project.

    ### Aim

    Our aim is to support scientists in health who are looking for resources on how to integrate sex and gender into their own research.

    ### Research team

    Genderful Research Consortium (GRC): We are a group of international multidisciplinary scientists (from biomedical to clinical and public health researchers) focusing in (very) different research topics with the common goal to perform and promote sex/gender-inclusive research. The consortium came together after the members were awarded with the ZonMw Gender in Research Fellowship.

    ### Funded by

    ZonMw (Netherlands) and CIHR-IGH (Canada)

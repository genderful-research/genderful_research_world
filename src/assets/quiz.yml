      question: Sex and gender are always the same thing.
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. Sex refers to sets of biological traits of people and animals. It is associated with physical differences in chromosomes, gene-expression, hormone levels/functions and reproductive and sexual anatomy. It is often divided into males and females, while gender refers to a more complex interplay between socially constructed roles, behaviors, expressions and identities of girls, women, men, boys and gender diverse people. They are not the same, but they can interact with each other.

      question: The term “sex” should not be used in the context of research as it means sexual intercourse. 
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. Sex can mean sexual intercourse or it can mean the biological differences between males and females. The fact that it has two meanings should never be the argument to avoid sex-sensitive research or reporting on sex differences, or replacing “sex” with the term “gender”.  
    - id: "definitions-q-3"
      question: Sex refers to biological attributes in humans and animals, while gender refers to socially constructed roles, behaviors, expressions and identities.
      correct_answer: true
      explanation: This is true. Sex refers to sets of biological traits of people and animals. It is associated with physical differences inchromosomes, gene-expression, hormone levels/functions and reproductive and sexual anatomy. It is often divided into males and females, while gender refers to a more complex interplay between socially constructed roles, behaviors, expressions and identities of girls, women, men, boys and gender diverse people.  
    - id: "definitions-q-4"
      question: Gender refers to biological attributes in humans and animals, while sex refers to socially constructed roles, behaviors, expressions and identities. 
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. Gender refers to a complex interplay of identities and expectations associated with a girl, woman, boy, man, or gender-diverse person.  
    - id: "definitions-q-5"
      question: Sex and gender are two separate dimensions that do not influence each other. 
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. Although there are two difference definitions for sex an gender, they can interact and influence with each other. For example, sex can influence gene-expression. Gene-expression is also influenced by epigenetic regulation, which can be changed by certain lifestyle choices such as smoking. The behavior of smoking is influenced by gender roles in society (gender), which thereby via epigenetic regulation can influence gene-expression (sex).

      question: Sex is always defined as sex assigned at birth.
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. Sex refers to the biological attributes in humans and animals and can be divided differently depending on the situation. Sex can also be defined based on chromosomes(XX/XY), which can differ from sex defined at birth due to mutations in the SRY gene (development of external genitalia). In public health and clinical research, sex is often defined as sex assigned at birth, but be aware that other options are possible.

      question: Taking a sex- and gender-based approach in research is beneficial for men, women, and gender-diverse people. 
      correct_answer: true
      explanation: This is true. Research best tailored to their target population gives the most precise knowledge.  
    - id: "definitions-q-8"
      question: Gender is a concept that cannot be objectively measured. 
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. Gender questionnaires and indexes to measure gender exist, and this is an area that is continuing to develop. Note that which concept of gender you focus on (e.g., gender identity vs. gender expression) will influence which empirical measurement you want to use.

  title: What are the relevance of accounting for sex/gender in biomedical and health research?

      question: Taking a sex-specific approach leads to discrimination
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. By accounting for sex in biomedical and health research, scientists are contributing for a more equal/balanced healthcare, also improving the rigor, reproducibility and generalization of science. Due to equity based health care (recognizing that not everybody benefits from the same care) we will avoid discrimination.

      question: Performing sex-specific research costs more money
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. In the short term, it may seems more costly and it can be, however, not accounting for sex differences along the different research phases will lead to a failure in efficacy of treatment/healthcare in the long term, which costs more money. To illustrate, performing sex-specific analysis on the side effects of the COVID vaccination during the trails could have avoided the surprise of side effects among women compared to men. The latter cost much more money.

      question: Gender concept as in humans do not apply directly to animals
      correct_answer: true
      explanation: This is true. Gender is defined as socially constructed roles, behaviours, expressions and identities from girls, women, boys, men and gender-diverse people. This definition does not directly apply to animals since they do not have such a societal environment as humans do. .

      question: Female inclusion in animal experiments increase variability
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. That was a misconception common across the scientific community, which was based on the sex hormone fluctuation (Prendergast, Onishi et al. 2014, Becker, Prendergast et al. 2016, Beery 2018). It turns out males tend to have higher variation, which can be linked to external stressors related to the expression of dominance and power dynamics inherent to males.

      question: Sex awareness is unimportant to in vitro studies
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. Depending on what cell types used for in vitro studies (primary cells, cell lines), different details might need to be taken in consideration. Until now, there has been an overlook on the sex of cells being used. Resources on Analyzing Sex in Tissues and Cells can be found here [Analyzing Sex in Tissues and Cells](https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/methods/tissues.html).

      question: Excluding women from clinical studies is always necessary to protect their fertility
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. This was a common understanding for clinical studies in the past decades. However, by excluding women from clinical studies there is an increased risk on fertility since these side effects will not be discovered during clinical trials before going to the market.

      question: Reporting sex differences should only be mentioned when significant
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. Mentioning that no sex differences were observed is also relevant, as it will prevent future studies to investigate these sex differences.

      question: Patient gender influences the treatment efficiency
      correct_answer: true
      explanation: This is true. The patient's gender influences treatment adherence and side effects due to motivational and stress differences.

      question: Healthcare professional gender does not influence patient care
      correct_answer: false
      explanation: This is false. The gender of the healthcare profession can have a great influence on patient care in multiple dimensions, among which how the patient perceives care, the type of complaints shared with professionals (https://www.ntvg.nl/artikelen/mannelijke-vrouwelijke-huisarts/abstract) and even delay visit to the doctor because he/she is of other sex.

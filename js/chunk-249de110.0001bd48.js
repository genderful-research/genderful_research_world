Although there are two difference definitions for sex an gender, they can interact and influence with each other. To give an example. Sex refers to biological traits, such as gene-expression. Gene-expression is influenced by epigenetic regulation, which can be changed by certain lifestyle choices such as smoking. The behavior of smoking is influenced by gender roles in society (gender) , which thereby via epigenetic regulation can influence gene-expression (sex)."},{id:"definitions-q-6",question:"Sex is always defined as sex given at birth.",correct_answer:!1,explanation:"This is false. Sex refers to the biological attributes in humans and animals and can be divided differently depending on the situation. Sex can also be defined as chromosomal situation (XX/XY), which can differ from sex defined at birth due to mutations in the SRY gene (development of external genitalia). In public health and clinical research, sex is often defined as sex given at birth, but be aware that other options are possible."},{id:"definitions-q-7",question:"Sex and gender approach in research is beneficial for both men and women.",correct_answer:!0,explanation:"This is true.

By accounting for sex in biomedical and health research, scientists are contributing for a more equal/balanced healthcare, also improving the rigor, reproducibility and generalization of science.

In the short term, it may seems more costly and it can be, however, not accounting for sex differences along the different research phases will lead to a failure in efficacy of treatment/healthcare in the long term, which costs more money. To illustrate, performing sex-specific analysis on the side effects of the COVID vaccination during the trails could have avoided the surprise of side effects among women compared to men. The latter cost much more money."},{id:"relevance-q-3",question:"Gender concept as in humans do not apply directly to animals",correct_answer:!0,explanation:"This is true. Gender is defined as socially constructed roles, behaviours, expressions and identities from girls, women, boys, men and gender-diverse people. This definition does not directly apply to animals since they do not have such a societal environment as humans do. ."},{id:"relevance-q-4",question:"Female inclusion in animal experiments increase variability",correct_answer:!1,explanation:"This is false. That was a misconception common across the scientific community, which was based on the sex hormone fluctuation (Prendergast, Onishi et al. 2014, Becker, Prendergast et al. 2016, Beery 2018).

Depending on what cell types used for in vitro studies (primary cells, cell lines), different details might need to be taken in consideration.
